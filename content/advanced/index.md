Welcome to the **Advanced** part of the workshop.

This part of the workshop focuses on how you can extend creation, provisioning, and management capabilities of [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) with resource types you develop.

You leverage the [AWS CloudFormation registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html) to manage extensions that you can choose to use in your account. Extensions can be public or private. They include [modules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/modules.html), that give you the ability to encapsulate configurations and best-practice building blocks that users can describe and consume in CloudFormation templates, and [resource types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html).
